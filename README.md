# Overview

This repository is a representation of my knowledge of how to build applications in Java.

It illustrates the following topics:

- Understanding of the core Spring Boot ecosystem
- How dependency injection works in Java
- How to work with entities in Spring JPA Persistence
- How to build a RESTful API in Java

A docker compose file has also been added and is a pre-generated template from the Spring Initializr tool from Spring Boot.  

It includes a Postgres DB and stores data in the Postgres database.  The schema is autogenerated via Spring Boot and the entities defined under data/entities.

Take a look and see if this helps you on your software development journey.

Thanks for coming by - cheers!
